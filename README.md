# Stochastic-Modeling-of-Cu-Ni-Sulfide-Orebodies-Driven-by-Data-Knowledge-Integration
Hello, nice to meet you. Here is the paper "Stochastic Modeling of Cu-Ni Sulfide Orebodies Driven by Data-Knowledge Integration: the data repository of "A Case Study from the Eastern Tianshan Cu-Ni Deposit". We will upload the source code when the paper is accepted. However, due to the confidentiality agreement signed between us and the mining area, we are sorry to inform you that we cannot disclose the geological data. But don't lose heart! We will give you a sample piece of data to help you better understand my code!
